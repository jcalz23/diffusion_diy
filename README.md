Exploring Diffusion Models: A Hands-On Approach with MNIST

In this project, I dive into the world of diffusion models by training a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) and a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) from scratch on the MNIST dataset.

This code was derived from was initially referenced from a [notebook](was referenced from a notebook provided in the article, “Understanding Stable Diffusion from Scratch”, a resource made available by Harvard’s “Machine Learning from Scratch” seminar series.) provided in the article, [“Understanding Stable Diffusion from Scratch”](https://scholar.harvard.edu/binxuw/classes/machine-learning-scratch/materials/stable-diffusion-scratch), a resource made available by Harvard’s “Machine Learning from Scratch” seminar series.
